    ## Setup
    * Windows 11 21H2
    * IntelliJ IDEA 2021.3 (Community Edition)
 
    ## Enhancement 
    1. Add a clock at the bottom-right corner.
    2. Add a button "Delete". Once this button gets clicked, the current dataset will be removed. The next displayed dataset would be the first dataset. If there is no dataset left, "Delete" button and the choice box will be disabled. A line of text will be shown upon the screen to tell the user to create a new dataset.
